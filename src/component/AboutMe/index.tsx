          Hi, Iâ€™m a front-end developer with 7 years of experience in web and
          mobile technologies. I have expertise in NextJS, ReactJS, React
          Native, Angular, and Typescript. I have worked on a lot of kinds of
          projects, from small websites to large-scale web applications and
          mobile apps. I have mentored junior and mid-level front-end developers
          and helped them improve their coding skills and best practices. I have
          also worked on a project with GFT Costa Rica, a leading IT company,
          where I built a web app that manages industry assets. I have developed
          web and mobile apps for various platforms, such as iOS and Android,
          using React Native and native technologies. I have a keen eye for
          design and usability and I can create beautiful and user-friendly
          interfaces that work well on different devices and resolutions. I can
          work under pressure and deliver high-quality results within tight
          deadlines. I am proactive and always eager to learn new things and
          take on new challenges. I work fast and efficiently, without
          compromising quality or functionality. I love web and mobile
          development and I enjoy creating amazing user experiences that solve
          real problems. I am looking for long-term or short-term projects where
          I can use my skills and knowledge to help you achieve your goals.
